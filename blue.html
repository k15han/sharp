										<p>One windy noonday of my early teen years, after feeding me mouthfuls of rice and dal and all the best she could cook during the day, my mother sat down to tell me a story. The plains of Ganges would resemble a frying pan in summer had there been mustard oil flowing in the rivers. But that one noon, as cool breeze jostled past the iris plant in our backyard, the sunbeams on the feathers of white and green appeared to be dancing, and it didn’t feel like yet another day of the scorching Indian summer.

											<br><br>Mother started off the narration in such passion as if she had been thinking and articulating it in her head all day long. It was about nani-ma, her mother, who once turned so sick she probably got death anxiety. Knowing that she might die any moment soon, she had hidden, as much as she could stack, a fair amount of money and two necklaces of gold or gold-plated bronze right under the sheets of her bed. So, it be found as an ancestral mark or blessing or many more things under its ambiguity when she finally bid farewell. However, events turned out quite opposite of what nani-ma had thought. She had been receiving medical treatment that had finally started showing results and curing her ailment.
											
											<br><br>Weeks slipped past her waxen eyes and weak memory as under treatment she gradually regained the hopes to live. And when one fine day it finally struck her about the small legacy she had been planning to leave behind for it to come as a surprise to her dear ones, she went searching. This was when my mother, who had found the money and necklaces, told nani-ma that she had put it back in the cash locker.
											
											<br><br>‘But why did she hide those things?’
											
											<br><br>Mother’s answers to follow-up questions are generally vague and was this time as well. She is a good narrator but certainly not an explainer.
											
											<br><br>Granma was perhaps one accomplished storyteller. Her voice had the audacity of the Himalayas, the modesty of Mithila, and the opulence of Ganga. When she set off narrating, she could perfectly modulate the heroics of the king and the wickedness of the invader. And in forefront of the fascination of her storytelling was that she was never out of new tales to tell.
											
											<br><br>One evening almost a decade later, engrossed in the bits of one of the accounts from Mahabharata spilled by Granma, Nani-ma’s story struck me. I told her how she had hidden money and necklaces under her bedsheet to be discovered later and asked her whether it was common in our family.
											
											<br><br>‘Your great-grandmother,’, recounted Granma, ‘when she died, left behind the only briefcase she owned all her life.’ It was another story setting out; her eyes brimmed with passion and head bowed in retrospection.
											
											<br><br>‘It was the year 1996, a year prior to your birth. Your great-grandma was a woman of resilience and prowess. She stood for me and the family, stood against patriarchal norms when it tried to breach familial affairs, and whenever conditions so demanded. I was blessed to have her’, Granma’s lightened up face suddenly appeared to have hit the dark, ‘But that year was one of termination. Inertia. Grief. Falling off the edge.’
											
											<br><br>‘What happened?’ I felt an alarm.
											
											<br><br>‘It was the sudden demise of your Great-Grandfather. He suffered a heart-attack. The sorrow it brought, alongside the climbing old age, eclipsed the vibrance of great-grandma’, Granma heaved a sigh, ‘So she started insisting that the house she was brought into as a bride, must be the house she dies in.’
											
											<br><br>Between the slight pauses of the sentences it occurred to me how Granma had always admired the affinity and bond shared by great-grandfather and great-grandmother, which in the couples of later generations have become like the one shared by stakeholders of a firm.
											
											<br><br>‘It’s tiring even to talk about it’, she would say.
											
											<br><br>Great-grandma died as per she wished, one night as she went for bed and never woke up. When her briefcase was found and opened, an amount of fifteen hundred rupees, three sets of bangles- each with its perimeter etched with pearls, two never-worn blue shawls and one white saree was collected. The custom demands a widow to wear no colour but white. Granma was dubious whether great-grandma had three or two pairs of white sarees. Perhaps two, one she had been wearing the day she passed away. Second one was found in her briefcase, may be kept for the other day. However, as Granma recalled, she was never seen touching the briefcase even when it was hers.
											
											<br><br>‘What did you do with the things?’
											
											<br><br>‘Your grandpa took the money, I took the shawls and the bangles, and the saree was given as an offering at the village temple’, Granma replied.
											
											<br><br>‘But I haven’t seen you wear any blue shawls?’
											
											<br><br>‘It has been a long time since, Tunu. One shawl got old and torn and had to be given up, but the other one got lost I suppose.’
											
											<br><br>‘I wonder why things just disappear from our sight.’
											
											<br><br>‘To be found at the right time?’
											
											<br><br>‘And when is that?’
											
											<br><br>‘Well, for shawls, it ought to be winter.’
											
											<br><br>We both chuckled.
											
											<p style="text-align: center"><b>**</b></p>
											
											I kept toiling the dubiousness that skulked in my head every time I heard a story of similar sort. The reasons behind such doing and the whys owing to its limitedness within the female members. Mother thought they did so because of the desire to leave behind a trail of their presence. In the form a valuable heirloom, like a necklace or a pair of golden bangles, that needed to be preserved and passed on to succeeding generation. But what about the money, and for how long could items that become valuable over time escape greed?
											
											<br><br>Granma had said that she was uncertain whether the sums of money signify blessing or the distrust over proper performance of their last rights and rituals. But it is stifling to realise how thorough concerns regarding finance was pervasive in the minds of people back then that they took it to their deathbeds.
											
											<br><br>‘And why has no male members thought of doing so?’ I had asked Granma.
											
											<br><br>‘They don’t have to.’
											
											<br><br>‘Why not? Didn’t they wish to be remembered?’
											
											<br><br>‘They sure did’, Granma never got tired of my inquisitiveness, ‘But as a capable and affluent guardian.’
											
											<br><br>I was baffled.
											
											<br><br>‘And slight amount of money and few trinkets, they believed, cannot display affluence.’
											
											<br><br>‘So instead they considered to just forget about it?’ I mocked.
											
											<br><br>‘No, child’, Granma smiled, ‘The male members leave behind the real legacy. Patrimony, it’s called. In forms of acres of lands and farms, one or more houses, flocks of cattle and even motorbikes nowadays.’
											
											<br><br>Perhaps nani-ma and great-grandma had no land or house assigned to their name, but they still wished to leave behind a legacy.
											
											<p style="text-align: center"><b>**</b></p>
											
											Not long enough I found myself living one such story.
											
											<br><br>For as long as I could remember Granma, she had been unwell all her life. In and out of pain. However, her frail body seemed about to drop off when I had reached my freshman year. I stayed far from home for study, as I had most of my life. So, when mother called me to visit over Granma’s worsening health, I hurried back home.
											
											<br><br>‘The doctor gave up saying her body had grown too old for medicines to work’, mother informed. I was shattered.
											
											<br><br>Few days scurried by and Granma breathed her last. Everyone in the family was struck by sorrow. Some cried. Some faked a wail. I couldn’t produce any emotion and became numb for long. It was when mother brought me a briefcase and told me to open it that I recovered my senses.
											
											<br><br>The briefcase, auburn in colour, looked as if it had worn out a century of time and still had its parts intact. It had criss-cross creases on top, the same design Pandora’s box had as Granma had described in its story.
											
											<br><br>‘Whose briefcase is this?’ I asked mother.
											
											<br><br>‘Granma’s.’
											
											<br><br>I turned my gaze back at the briefcase. An aura like that of Pandora’s box radiating from it tempted me to open it.
											
											<br><br>‘Don’t you want to know what Granma left for us?’, added mother.
											
											<br><br>I opened it. It was empty, except for one blue shawl.
											
											<br><br>‘That’s the shawl great-grandma had left behind’, mother exclaimed.
											
											<br><br>We both were astonished.
											
											<br><br>‘It’s an heirloom’, I said after a long pause, ‘And it’s for you, mother.’
